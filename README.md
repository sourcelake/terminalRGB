# Functions
There are 2 functions currently.
`coloured(text:string,colour: tuple)`
and
`cprint(text:string,colour: tuple)`
...
yes, there are the same (on a writing pov) but cprint will print coloured text, and coloured will return coloured text
# why did i make this?
because termcolor only supports not many colours.

# details
I am not from the US. so you cant perfectly pick up terminalRGB from termcolor, especially if you're a user of eng-us.
